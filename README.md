Progress for LeetCode :D <br>
Did some (~ 20 - 30) miscellaneous practice before this repo<br>
Steep learning curve because unfamiliarity with Python; may have some java solution here and there

- Practice Session Method:
    - 20 minutes: Review problems from 3 & 7 days ago 
    - Practice Problems (realistically 1 or 2 problems a day during semester)
- Practice Problem Method (Suggested Timeframe & Guideline: template.py):
    1. 10 minutes attempt; pseudocode/explanation
    2. 15-20 minutes learning with exisitng solution
    3. 10 minutes writing down replicating solution from understanding
    4. 20 Review + Reflection
- Notes to self:
    - DO NOT RUSH A PROBLEM EVEN IF IT SEEMS "EASY"
    - Important to learn the different ways to manipulate data structures
    - Try to learn the approach and techniques >> memorizing the specific solution
    - Stay consistent & slay :D
